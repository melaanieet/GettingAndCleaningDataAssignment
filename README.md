Course Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

This repository is my submission for completing the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

The code book uploaded describes the variables, the data, and any work that was performed to clean up the data. 

The RScript run_analysis.R prepares the data and shows the 5 steps required for the project. Merging the training and datatests to create one data set. Then, extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Then, descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Next, appropriate labels data set with descriptive variable names was changed. The data set from previous step to create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. A text file TidyData.txt was then created to finalise all the steps from above
