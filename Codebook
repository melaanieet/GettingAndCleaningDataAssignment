Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables
metafeatures <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activitiesLabels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
featurestest <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
activityTest <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
subjectTrain <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
featuresTrain <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
activityTrain <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
subject (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging subjectTrain and subjectTest using rbind() function
activity(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging activityTrain and activityTest using rbind() function
features(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging featuresTrain and featuresTest using rbind() function

Naming Columns and merging
naming metafeature to features
naming "Activity" to activity
naming "Subject" to subject

complete_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging features, activity, subject using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
extractedData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the completeData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
TidyData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export TidyData into TidyData.txt file.
